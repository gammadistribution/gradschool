\begin{problem}{6}
  Let $f(x) = ax^3+bx+c$ where $a$ and $b$ satisfy $a/b > 0$. Denote by $N_f$
  the corresponding Newton function.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $N_f$ has a unique fixed point.
    \item Show that $N_f$ cannot have any period 2 points.
    \item Why does it follow that $N_f$ has no points of period $n$ for $n>2$?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
