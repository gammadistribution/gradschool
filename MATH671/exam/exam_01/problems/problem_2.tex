\begin{problem}{2}
  Let $\displaystyle g_\mu(x) = \mu x \frac{(1-x)}{(1+x)}$, for $\mu > 0$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g_\mu$ has a maximum at $x = \sqrt{2} - 1$ and the maximum value is
      $\mu(3 - 2\sqrt{2})$.
    \item Deduce that $g_\mu$ is a dynamical system on $[0, 1]$
      for $0 \leq \mu \leq 3 + 2\sqrt{2}$, i.e. $g_\mu([0,1])\subseteq[0,1]$.
    \item Find the fixed points of $g_\mu$ for $mu \geq 1$.
    \item Find $g_\mu'$ and determine whether the fixed points are attracting
      or repelling.
    \item Use a graphing utility to graph $g_\mu^2$ and $g_\mu^3$
      and estimate when a period 2 point is created.
  \end{enumerate}
