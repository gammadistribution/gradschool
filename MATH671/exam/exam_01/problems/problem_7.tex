  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the function $f(x) = -1/(x+1)$ has the property that $f^3(x) = x$
      for all $x\neq-1,0$.
    \item Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function
      defined on a set $I$, with $f^3(x) = x$ for all $x\in I$. Set $g(x) = f^2(x)$.
      Show that $g^3(x) = x$ for all $x\in I$. Deduce a function different from that
      in a) that has this property.
    \item In general, show that such a function cannot have a 2-cycle.
    \item Deduce that a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ with the property $f^3(x) = x$
      cannot be continuous.
    \item Show that the inverse of $f$ must exist.
    \item If $f'(x)$ exists for all $x\in I$, show that the 3-cycles are non-hyperbolic where $f$ is not the identity map.
    \item Suppose that $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d}$ satisfies $f^3(x) = x$. Show that if $f$ is not the identity map
      and $a\neq d$, then $a^2 +bc + ad +d^2 = 0$.
      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
        \item Use this to find other functions with the property $f^3(x) = x$.
        \item Deduce that if $ad- bc > 0$, then such a function cannot have any fixed points.
