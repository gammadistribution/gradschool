\begin{problem}{3}
  Consider the family of functions $f_\lambda(x) = x^3 - \lambda x$ for some parameter
  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find all fixed points and determine their nature and where they
      are created as $\lambda$ varies.
    \item Find where a 2-cycle is created
      and give the graph of where this happens. Determine the stability of the
      hyperbolic 2-cycles.
    \item Use a graphing utility to find an approximate
      value of $\lambda$ where the 3-cycle is created. Give the graph of this situation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
