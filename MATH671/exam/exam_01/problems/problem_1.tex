\begin{problem}{1}
  You pay into an annuity a sum of $\$P$ dollars. This annuity
  pays you $\$\alpha$ per month. The annual interest is $r%$ and is calculated
  as simple interest on the remaining balance at the end of each year. If $A(n)$
  is the amount remaining at the end of the $n$-th month, with $A(0) = P$,
  write down $A(n+1)$ in terms of $A(n)$ and deduce a closed form solution
  for $A(n)$.

  If $P = \$100,000$, $\alpha = \$500$, and the interest rate is $4\%$ per year,
  how long will the annuity last?
