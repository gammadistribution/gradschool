\begin{problem}{1.4.8}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose that $f(c) = f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) \neq 0$. If $f''(x)$ is continuous at $x = c$,
      show that the Newton function $N_f (x)$ has a removable discontinuity at $x = c$. (Hint:
      Apply L’Hopital’s rule to $N_f$ at $x = c$.)
    \item If in addition, $f'''(x)$ is continuous at $x = c$ with $f'''(c) \neq 0$,
      show that $N_f'(c) = 1/2$, so that $x = c$ is not a super-attracting fixed point in this case.
    \item Check the above for the function $f(x) = x^3 − x^2$ with $c = 0$.
