\begin{problem}{1.4.1}
  Find the fixed points and determine their stability for the function $$f(x) = \frac{6}{x} - 1.$$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The fixed points of the function $f(x)$ are the roots of the function
  \begin{align*}
    g(x)
    &= f(x) - x \\
    &= \frac{6}{x} - 1 - x \\
    &= -\frac{(x+3)(x+2)}{6}.
  \end{align*}
  We readily see that the roots of $g(x)$, which are the fixed points of $f(x)$,
  are given by $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

  According to Theorem 1.4.4, since $f(x)$ is a $C^1$ function, we may use the derivative
  of $f(x)$ to classify its fixed points. If $c$ is a fixed point of $f$ and
  $\left|f'(c)\right| < 1$, then $c$ is an asymptotically stable fixed point, while $\left|f'(c)\right| > 1$
  indicates that $c$ is a repelling (unstable) fixed point.

  Note that $f'(x) = -6/x^2.$ For the fixed point $x=-3$, we see that
  \begin{align*}
    \left|f'(-3)\right| = \left|- \frac{6}{(-3)^2}\right| = \frac{2}{3} < 1
  \end{align*}
  from which we classify the point $x=-3$ as an asymptotically stable fixed point.
  On the other hand, for the fixed point $x=2$, we see that
  \begin{align*}
    \left|f'(2)\right| = \left|- \frac{6}{(2)^2}\right| = \frac{3}{2} > 1
  \end{align*}
  from which we classify the point $x=-3$ as a repelling (unstable) fixed point.
\end{proof}
