\begin{problem}{10.5.4}
  Let $f(x) = x^2- a$ with $1 < a < 3$ and let $N_f$ be the corresponding Newton
  function of $f$. Show that $N_f$ satisfies the hypothesis of the Contraction Mapping
  Theorem on $[1, \infty)$. What is the fixed point?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Recall that the Newton function $N_f$ of a function $f$ is defined by
  \begin{align*}
    N_f(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}.
  \end{align*}
  If $f(x) = x^2- a$, then we see that
  \begin{align}\label{newton}
    N_f(x) = x - \frac{x^2-a}{2x} = \frac{x^2 + a}{2x}.
  \end{align}

  The function $N_f$ will satisfy the hypothesis of the Contraction Mapping Theorem on
  $Y = [1, \infty)$ if $(Y, d)$ is a complete metric space with $d$ the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}$
  and if $N_f: Y \to Y$ is a contraction mapping.

  Since $Y$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$, a complete metric space, we know that
  $Y$ must be a complete metric space. This is since any Cauchy sequence in $Y$ will
  converge to some point $x\in \mathbb{R}$, but since $Y$ is closed, i.e.\ it contains
  all of its limit points, the point $x$ must be in $Y$.

  All that is left is to show that $N_f$ is a contraction mapping, i.e.\ for all $x, y \in Y$,
  there is some $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    |N_f(x) - N_f(y)| \leq \alpha |x - y|.
  \end{align*}
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    |N_f(x) - N_f(y)| &= \left| \frac{x^2+a}{2x} - \frac{y^2+a}{2y} \right| \\
    &= \left|\frac{x^2y + ay - xy^2 - ax}{2xy}\right| \\
    &= \left|\frac{(x-y)(xy-a)}{2xy}\right| \\
    &= \frac{|x-y|}{2}\left|\frac{xy - a}{xy}\right|.
  \end{align*}
  Since $a > 1$ we have that $|xy-a| < |xy| $ which implies that $|(xy-a)/xy|\leq 1$.
  Thus,
  \begin{align*}
    |N_f(x) - N_f(y)| &= \frac{|x-y|}{2}\left|\frac{xy - a}{xy}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}|x-y|
  \end{align*}
  and $N_f$ is a contraction mapping with contraction constant $\alpha = 1/2$. Therefore, $N_f$
  satisfies the hypothesis of the Contraction Mapping Theorem on
  $Y = [1, \infty)$.

  By the Contraction Mapping Theorem, the fixed point of $N_f$ is the limit of its iterates.
  Since $N_f$ is the Newton function, we know that its iterates converge to a root of the function $f(x) = x^2-a$.
  Note that the iterates of $N_f$ are positive so they will converge to the positive root of $f$, i.e.\
  the fixed point of $N_f$ is $p=\sqrt{a}$.
\end{proof}
