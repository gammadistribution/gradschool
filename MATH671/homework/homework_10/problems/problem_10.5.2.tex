\begin{problem}{10.5.2}
  Show that the box-counting dimension of the Sierpinski triangle is $\log 3 / \log 2$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The Sierpinski triangle is formed by iteratively removing smaller and smaller
  equilateral triangles from an equilateral triangle of side-length 1. For an
  equilateral triangle of side-length $d$, the minimum size square that completely covers
  the triangle is the square of side-length $d$.

  For the first iteration of the Sierpinski triangle, we remove the open middle
  equilateral triangle, leaving 3 equilateral triangles of side-length $1/2$.
  Thus, we would require, at a minimum, 3 squares of side-length $1/2$ in order to completely
  cover the Sierpinski triangle. In the next iteration, we remove the open middle
  equilateral triangles of the remaining equilateral triangles, leaving 9 equilateral
  triangles of side-length $1/4$. Thus, we would, at a minimum, require 9 squares of side-length $1/4$
  in order to completely cover the Sierpinski triangle.

  In general, the $n$-th iteration will leave $3^n$ equilateral triangles of side length $1/2^n$ and
  we would require, at a minimum, $3^n$ squares of side-length $1/2^n$ in order to completely cover the Sierpinski triangle.
  Let $K$ be the Sierpinski triangle and let $N_{\delta_n}(K)$ be the minimum number of boxes of equal length $\delta_n > 0$
  needed to completely cover $K$ at iteration $n$. Then from our previous discussions, $N_{\delta_n}(K) = 3^n$
  with $\delta_n = 1/2^n$.

  Therefore, the box-counting dimension of the Sierpinski triangle $K$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \dim(K) = \lim_{\delta \to 0^+}\frac{\log N_\delta(K)}{\log 1/\delta} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log N_{\delta_n}(K)}{\log 1/\delta_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log 3^n}{\log 2^n} = \frac{\log 3}{\log 2}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
