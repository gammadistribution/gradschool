\begin{problem}{2.4.1}
  Let $f_c(x) = x^2 + c$, $c\in\mathbb{R}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For what values of $c$ does $f_c$ have a super-attracting fixed point
      and what is the fixed point?
    \item For what values of $c$ does $f_c$ have a super-attracting 2-cycle
      and what is the 2-cycle?
    \item Show that if $f_c$ has a super-attracting 3-cycle, then $c$ satisfies
      the equation
      \begin{align*}
        c^3 + 2c^2 +c +1 = 0
      \end{align*}
      and the 3-cycle is given by $\{0, c, c^2 + c\}$.
  \end{enumerate}
