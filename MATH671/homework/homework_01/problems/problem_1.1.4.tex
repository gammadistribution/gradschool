\begin{problem}{1.1.4}
  You borrow $\$P$ at $r\%$ per annum
  and pay off $\$M$ at the end of each subsequent month. Write down a difference
  equation for the amount owing $A(n)$ at the end of each month (so $A(0) = P$).
  Solve the equation to find a closed form for $A(n)$. If $P = 100,000$, $M = 1,000$,
  and $r=4$, after how long will the loan be paid off?
