\begin{problem}{1.2.6}
  Consider the eventual fixed points of the logistic map $L_{\mu}: [0,1] \to [0,1]$,
  $L_\mu(x)  = \mu x (1-x)$ for $0 < \mu < 4$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that there are no eventual fixed points associated with the fixed
      point $x=0$, other than $x=1$.
    \item Show that for $1 < \mu \leq 2,$ the only eventual fixed point associated
      with the fixed point $x = 1 - 1/\mu$ is $x = 1/\mu$.
    \item Show that there are additional eventual fixed points associated with $x = 1 - 1/\mu$
      when $2 < \mu < 3$.
    \item Investigate the eventual fixed points of the logistic map when $\mu = 5/2$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item It is clear that $x=1$ is an eventual fixed
      point since $x=0$ is a fixed point and $L_\mu(1) = 0$.
      This is the only eventual fixed point associated to $x=0$ since no point
      in the interval $(0, 1)$ maps to either 0 or 1 under $L_\mu$, i.e.\
      for $y\in(0,1)$, the equations $L_\mu(y) = 0$ and $L_\mu(y) = 1$
      have no solutions. Therefore, since no $y \in D_{L_\mu} = [0, 1]$ besides
      $y=0$ and $y=1$ maps to 0 or 1, there are no other eventual fixed points
      associated to $x=0$.
    \item Let $1 < \mu \leq 2$. It is clear that $x = 1/\mu$ is an eventual
      fixed point since $x = 1 - 1/\mu$ is a fixed point and
      $L_\mu(1/\mu) = 1 - 1/\mu$.
      We will now demonstrate that this is the only eventual fixed point
      associated to $x = 1 - 1/\mu$. Note that
      for $x \in [0, 1]$, the only solution to $L_\mu(x) = 1 - 1/\mu$ is $x = 1/\mu$.
      Therefore, in order for a point $x \in [0, 1]$ to be an eventual fixed point
      associated to $x = 1 - 1/\mu$, we must have that $x$ either maps to $1/\mu$
      or eventually maps to $1/\mu$, i.e.\ for $x \in [0, 1]$ we must have that
      $L_\mu(x) = 1/\mu$ has a solution. However, if $1 < \mu \leq 2$,
      then $L_\mu(x) = 1/\mu$ has no real solutions for $x \in [0, 1]$ and  so
      there are no other eventual fixed points associated to $x = 1 - 1/\mu$.
    \item Now suppose that $2 < \mu < 3$. Recall that $x = 1/\mu$ is an eventual fixed point.
      Note that
      $$y = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{m^2}} \in [0, 1]$$
      satisfies $L_\mu(y) = 1/\mu$. Thus, $L_\mu^2(y) = 1 - 1/\mu$ where $1 - 1/\mu$ is a fixed point.
      Therefore, if $2 < \mu < 3$, then there are additional eventual fixed points associated
      to $x = 1 - 1/\mu$ besides $x = 1/\mu$.
  \end{enumerate}
