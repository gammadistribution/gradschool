\begin{problem}{1.2.6}
  Consider the eventual fixed points of the logistic map $L_{\mu}: [0,1] \to [0,1]$,
  $L_\mu(x)  = \mu x (1-x)$ for $0 < \mu < 4$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that there are no eventual fixed points associated with the fixed
      point $x=0$, other than $x=1$.
    \item Show that for $1 < \mu \leq 2,$ the only eventual fixed point associated
      with the fixed point $x = 1 - 1/\mu$ is $x = 1/\mu$.
    \item Show that there are additional eventual fixed points associated with $x = 1 - 1/\mu$
      when $2 < \mu < 3$.
    \item Investigate the eventual fixed points of the logistic map when $\mu = 5/2$.
  \end{enumerate}
