\begin{problem}{1.1.7}
  Let $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$. Give conditions on $b$ and $c$ for $f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$
  to be a dynamical system. Hint: Recall that the maximum and minimum values of
  a continuous function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$ occur either at
  the end points or at the critical points of the function.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The function $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ for $f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ is a dynamical
  system if $f([0,1]) \subseteq [0,1]$. The minimum and maximum values of the function occur either at the end points of
  the domain or at the critical points of the function. Thus, for the continuous
  function $f$, if we ensure that the evaluation of $f$ at $x=0$, $x=1$, and
  the critical points of $f$ are contained in $[0, 1]$ then the image of $f$ will necessarily
  be contained in $[0, 1]$ and $f$ will be a dynamical system.

  At the end points of the domain we have that $f(0) = c$ and $f(1) = b + c + 1$. Thus, in order for $f$ to be
  a dynamical system, we must have that $c \in [0, 1]$ and $b + c \in [-1, 0]$.

  The only critical point of the function $f$ is found when $f'(x) = 0$ or when $x = -b/2$.
  Thus, we require that $f(-b/2) = -b^2/4 + c \in [0, 1]$. Under the assumption
  that $c\in[0, 1]$, this translates to requiring that $-4 \leq b^2 \leq 4$. Since the domain of the function is real,
  we also require that $bx \in \mathbb{R}$  so the previous requirement reduces to
  the constraint $0 \leq b \leq 2$.

\end{proof}
