\begin{problem}{1.1.7}
  Let $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$. Give conditions on $b$ and $c$ for $f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$
  to be a dynamical system. Hint: Recall that the maximum and minimum values of
  a continuous function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$ occur either at
  the end points or at the critical points of the function.
