\begin{problem}{1.1.3}
  A \emph{logistic difference equation} is one of the form $x_{n+1} = \mu x_{n} (1-x_n)$
  for some fixed $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$. Find exact (closed form) solutions to the following
  logistic difference equations:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $x_{n+1} = 2 x_{n} (1 - x_n)$. Hint: Use the substitution $x_n = (1 - y_n) / 2$
      to transform the equation into a simpler equation that is easily solved.
    \item $x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1 - x_n)$. Hint: Set $x_n = \sin^2(\theta_n)$ and simplify
      to get an equation that is easily solved.
  \end{enumerate}
