\begin{problem}{1.5.9}
  Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial such that $f(c) = c$. (Recall that a polynomial
  $p(x)$ has $(x-c)^2$ as a factor if and only if both $p(c) = 0$ and $p'(c) = 0$.)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $f'(c) = 1$, show that $(x-c)^2$ is a factor of $g(x) = f(x) - x$.
    \item If $|f'(c)| = 1$, show that $(x-c)^2$ is a factor of $h(x) = f^2(x) - x$.
    \item Show in the case that $f'(c) = -1$, we actually have that $(x-c)^3$ is a
      factor of $h(x) = f^2(x) - x$.
    \item Check that (iii) holds for the non-hyperbolic fixed point $x=2/3$ of the logistic
      map $L_3(x) = 3x(1-x)$.
    \item Check that (i), (ii), (iii) hold for the non-hyperbolic fixed points
      of the polynomial $f(x) = -2x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.
  \end{enumerate}
