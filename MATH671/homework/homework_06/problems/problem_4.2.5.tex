\begin{problem}{4.2.5}
  Show that the intersection of a finite number of open sets $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$
  in a metric space $(X, d)$ is an open set. Show that, by considering the intervals
  $(-1/n, 1/n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ in $\mathbb{R}$, the intersection of infinitely
  many open sets need not be open.
