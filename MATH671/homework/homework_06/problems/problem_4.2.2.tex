\begin{problem}{4.2.2}
  Show that the closed ball $B_\varepsilon[a] = \{x \in X \ |\ d(a, x) \leq \varepsilon\}$
  in a metric space is a closed set, but it need not be equal to the closure
  of the open ball $B_\varepsilon(a)$. (Hint: Consider the two point space $\mathcal{A}= \{0, 1\}$ with metric $d(0, 1) = 1$).
