\begin{problem}{4.2.2}
  Show that the closed ball $B_\varepsilon[a] = \{x \in X \ |\ d(a, x) \leq \varepsilon\}$
  in a metric space is a closed set, but it need not be equal to the closure
  of the open ball $B_\varepsilon(a)$. (Hint: Consider the two point space $\mathcal{A}= \{0, 1\}$ with metric $d(0, 1) = 1$).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  We wish to show that $B_\varepsilon[a]$ is closed, i.e.\ that $X \setminus B_\varepsilon[a]$ is open. Suppose that
  $x \in X \setminus B_\varepsilon[a]$. Then we have that $d(x, a) = \delta > \varepsilon$.
  Consider $B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$, the open ball centered at $x$ of radius $\varepsilon_1 = \delta - \varepsilon$.
  Suppose to the contrary that $y \in B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$ and $y\in B_\varepsilon[a]$.
  Since $a, x, y \in X$ with $X$ a metric space, we have that
  \begin{align*}
    d(x, a) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, a) < \delta - \varepsilon + \varepsilon = \delta = d(x, a).
  \end{align*}

  However, this is a contradiction since the distance between two points cannot be less than itself.
  Thus, we must have that if $y \in B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$,
  then $y \notin B_{\varepsilon}[a]$. Therefore, for every $x\in X \setminus B_\varepsilon[a]$,
  there exists an $\varepsilon_1 > 0$ such that $B_{\varepsilon_1}(x) \subseteq X \setminus B_\varepsilon[a]$
  and $X \setminus B_\varepsilon[a]$ is open so that $B_\varepsilon[a]$ is closed.

  Recall that $\overline{A}$, the closure of a set $A$, is the union of the set $A$ with its limit points,
  i.e.\ $\overline{A} = A \cup \text{Lim}\{A\}$ where $a \in X$ is a limit point if every open ball
  centered at $a$ contains a point in $A$ different from $a$.
  We wish to show that the closed ball centered at $a$ of a given radius
  does not necessarily coincide with the closure of the open ball centered at $a$ of the same radius.

  To see this, consider the metric space $X = \{0, 1\}$ equipped with the discrete metric
  and consider the point $0\in X$. The only open ball centered at 0 is given by
  \begin{align*}
    B_1(0)= \{x \in X \ |\ d(x, 0) < 1\} = \{0\}.
  \end{align*}
  Since the point $1$ is not in any open ball centered at $0$, we see that there are no limit points of
  $0$ and that $\overline{B_1(0)} = \{0\}$. However, the only closed ball centered at $0$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
    B_1[0] = \{x \in X \ |\ d(x, 0) \leq 1\} = \{0, 1\}
  \end{align*}
  and we see that $\overline{B_1(0)} \neq B_1[0]$.
  Therefore, we can clearly see that the closure of the open ball centered at a point $a\in X$
  of any radius is not necessarily equal to the closed ball centered at $a$ of the same radius.

\end{proof}
