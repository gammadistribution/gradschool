\begin{problem}{4.3.8}
  Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous map with fixed point $c$
  and basin of attraction $B_f(c) = (a, b)$, an interval. Show that one of the following must hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $a$ and $b$ are fixed points.
    \item $a$ or $b$ is fixed and the other is eventually fixed.
    \item $\{a, b\}$ is a 2-cycle.
  \end{enumerate}
