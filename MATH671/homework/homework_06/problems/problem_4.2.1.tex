\begin{problem}{4.2.1}
  Prove that every open ball $B_\varepsilon(a)$ in a metric space $(X, d)$ is an open set
  and that every finite subset of $X$ is a closed set.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Recall that a set $A \subseteq X$ is an open set if for all $a \in A$, there
  exists an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_\varepsilon(a) \subseteq A$. Thus, to
  show that $B_\varepsilon(a)$ is an open set, we will show that for each point in the open
  ball of radius $\varepsilon$ centered at $a$ there exists a neighborhood of
  that point that is completely contained in the open ball.

  So, let $x \in B_\varepsilon(a) = \{x \in X \ |\ d(x, a) < \varepsilon\}$ and
  suppose that $d(x, a) = \delta < \varepsilon$. We wish to find some $\varepsilon_1 > 0$
  such that $B_{\varepsilon_1}(x) \subseteq B_\varepsilon(a)$. Consider $B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$,
  the open ball centered at $x$ of radius $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon - \delta > 0$
  and let $y \in B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$. If $y\in B_{\varepsilon_1}(x)$, then $y\in X$ and $d(y, x) < \varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon - \delta$.
  Since $a, x, y \in X$ and $X$ is a metric space, we must have that
  \begin{align*}
    d(y, a) \leq d(y, x) + d(x, a) < \varepsilon - \delta + \delta = \varepsilon.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore, we have that $d(y, a) < \varepsilon$ and $y \in B_\varepsilon(a)$ so that $B_{\varepsilon_1}(x) \subseteq B_\varepsilon(a)$
  and the set $B_\varepsilon(a)$ must be open.

  We now wish to show that a finite subset $A = \{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n\} \subseteq X$ is a closed set.
  Recall that a set $A \subseteq X$ is closed if and only if $X \setminus A$ is open. Let $x \in X \setminus A$
  and consider $B_{\varepsilon}(x)$, the open ball centered at $x$ of radius $\varepsilon = \min_i\{d(x, a_i)\}$.
  Since $x \in X$ and $x \neq a_0, \dots, a_n$, we know that $\varepsilon = \min_i\{d(x, a_i)\} > 0$.

  Suppose to the contrary that $y \in B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ and $y = a_i$ for some $i=0,\dots, n$.
  Since $y, a_i \in X$ and $X$ is a metric space with $y = a_i$, we have that $d(y, a_i) = 0$.
  Thus, under the properties of the distance function of this metric space, we must have that
  \begin{align*}
    d(x, a_i) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, a_i) < \varepsilon = \min_i\{d(x, a_i)\}.
  \end{align*}
  However, this is a contradiction since an element of a set cannot be strictly
  less than the minimum of that set. Thus, if $y \in B_{\varepsilon}(x)$, then $y \neq a_i$ for any $i=0,\dots, n$.
  Therefore, $B_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq X \setminus A$ and $X \setminus A$ is open so that $A$ is closed.
\end{proof}
