\begin{problem}{4.2.7}
  Let $f: I \to I$ be a continuous function defined on an interval $I$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What can you say about the graph of $f$, if $f$ has a dense set of
      points with $f^2(x) = x$?
    \item Show that the inverse of $f$ must exist and that $f$ must have at least
      one fixed point.
    \item Deduce that if there exists an $x \in I$ with $f(x) \neq x$, then $f$ must be strictly decreasing.
    \item If $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \in I$, show that the 2-cycles are non-hyperbolic,
      and any fixed point $x_0$ is non-hyperbolic of the type $f'(x_0)=-1$, when $f$ is not the identity map.
    \item Give an example of a function of the type appearing in iv.
  \end{enumerate}
