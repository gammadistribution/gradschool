The single most important property of the scheme presented in
\eqref{numerical_scheme} is its convergence to the analytical solution. We will
now rigorously define this notion of convergence.

But first, we must define the measure of the deviation between two solutions.
Let $U_h$ be the normed linear space of all functions defined on the grid $D_h$
as presented in \eqref{uniform_grid}. For $u^{(h)} \in U_h$, the equipped norm is
given as
\begin{align}\label{norm}
  ||u^{(h)}|| = \sup_n |u_n| = \max_n |u_n|.
\end{align}
With this definition, we can then precisely define the measure of deviation
between two solutions $a^{(h)}$ and $b^{(h)}$ as $||a^{(h)} - b^{(h)}||$.

Thus, we say that the solution $u^{(h)}$ derived from the
scheme $L_h u^{(h)} = f^{(h)}$ \textit{converges} to the discretized analytical
solution $[u]_h$ of the problem $Lu = f$ if
\begin{align}\label{convergence_def}
  \left|\left|[u]_h - u^{(h)}\right|\right| \to 0 \quad \text{as $h \to 0$}.
\end{align}

We now present strong numerical evidence that our scheme $L_h u^{(h)} = f^{(h)}$
converges to the discretized analytical solution of the problem $Lu = f$. The
program used to create the following tables can be found in appendix \ref{append_convergence}.

Table \ref{con} shows the values of the computed norm $\left|\left|[u]_h - u^{(h)}\right|\right|$ for
decreasing values of $h$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. For this table, we declare $c=1$ with the
initials conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 0$ for various definitions of
the function $f(x)$ in the problem $Lu = f$.

\end{table}

The results found in Table \ref{con} suggest that the normed difference between the approximate solution
and the exact solution does tend toward zero as we refine the grid value $h$ and
that this happens regardless of the choice of $f(x)$. Thus, the scheme converges
to the exact solution for the problem $Lu = f$ if $c=1$ with initial conditions
$u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 0$.

A natural question would then be if the convergence is dependent upon the choice
of $c$. As the convergence of the scheme does not appear to depend on $f(x)$, we
fix $f(x) = e^{0.5x}$ with initial conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 0$ and investigate
the values of $\left|\left|[u]_h - u^{(h)}\right|\right|$ for varying values of $c$.
Table \ref{con_c} contains the above described computations.

\end{table}

The evidence presented in Table \ref{con_c} suggests that for decreasing values of $h$,
the value $\left|\left|[u]_h - u^{(h)}\right|\right|$ tends to 0. Thus, the convergence of the
scheme is not dependent on the value of $c$ in the problem $Lu = f$.

The last aspect of convergence to investigate is the impact of the initial conditions
in the problem $Lu = f$ on the scheme's convergence.
Table \ref{tab:con} shows the values of $||[u]_h - u^{h}||$ for various
initial conditions with $f(x) = e^{0.5x}$ and $c=1$.

From the results in Table \ref{tab:con} we see that for decreasing values
of $h$, the value $\left|\left|[u]_h - u^{(h)}\right|\right|$ tends to 0 and we
conclude that the approximate solution
converges to the exact solution regardless of the choice in initial conditions for the function
$f(x) = e^{0.5x}$.

Therefore, from the numerical evidence presented, the convergence of the
scheme $L_h u^{(h)} = f^{(h)}$ is not dependent on the function $f(x)$, the constant
$c$, nor the initial conditions found in the problem $Lu =f$ and we conclude that
the scheme is convergent.
