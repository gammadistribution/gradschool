There are three main properties of the numerical scheme presented in section
\ref{sec:scheme} that are important to the validity of the numerical solution,
namely the convergence, consistency, and stability of the numerical scheme.
We will now investigate these properties in detail to determine how well
the numerical scheme approximates the analytical solution to our differential
equation.
