For the given problem $Lu=f$ defined in the introduction,
we have shown that the problem does indeed have an analytical solution and that
the problem is well-posed. As this analytical solution is computationally expensive
and may not have a closed form solution for certain functions $f$, we developed
a numerical scheme to approximate the analytical solution.

With supporting numerical evidence, this scheme was found to be convergent to the exact solution, consistent, and stable suggesting
that the numerical scheme provides a good approximation to the exact solution as
the grid of the numerical scheme becomes more refined. We have also created an
implementation of this approximate solution for practical use. Namely, we have provided
means for plotting and evaluating the approximate solution at any point of the
interval of definition for the problem $Lu = f$. This implementation satisfies
the main requests of the client.
