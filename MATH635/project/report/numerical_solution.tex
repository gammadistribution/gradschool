\begin{section}{Introduction}
  The authors were tasked by the client with finding the solution to the following
  family of differential equations
  \[
  \begin{cases}
    -u''(x) + c u(x) = f(x) \\
    0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
    u(0) = \epsilon \\
    u(1) = \delta.
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Additionally, the client has also requested to be provided with a means of
  plotting the solution once obtained.

  Throughout this report, the above family of differential equations together with
  the interval of definition and initial conditions will be represented by
  $Lu = f$.

  Assumptions were placed on this family so that $c \in \mathbb{R}$ with $c > 0$
  and $f \in C^k([0,1])$ for sufficiently large $k$ so that $f$ is relatively
  well-behaved on the defined interval.

  In this report we will detail the analytical solution to this family of
  differential equations showing the the above problem is well-posed and
  explain why this solution is not amenable to practical use. We therefore
  provide a numerical scheme to approximate the solution to the family of
  differential equations and examine the convergence, consistency and stability
  of the numerical scheme. Using the solution provided by the numerical scheme,
  we then explore the different options for plotting the solution.

\begin{section}{Analytical Solution}
  The family of differential equations $Lu = f$ represents a second order linear
  differential equation and therefore well-known techniques can be used to find
  the solution $u(x)$.

  The solution $u(x)$ is given by $u(x) = u_h(x) + u_p(x)$ where $u_h(x)$ is
  the solution to the homogeneous equation $-u''(x) + c u(x) = 0$ and $u_p(x)$
  is a particular solution of $-u''(x) + c u(x) = f(x)$.

  To find the homogeneous solution, note that the characteristic equation of
  this family of differential equations is given by $-m^2 + c = 0$ the roots of
  which are $m_1 = \sqrt{c} = \omega $ and $m_2 = -\sqrt{c} = -\omega$. Note
  that since $c > 0$, these roots are real and distinct suggesting that the
  homogeneous solution is given by
  \begin{align}\label{homogeneous_solution}
    u_h(x) = c_1 e^{\omega x} + c_2 e^{-\omega x}.
  \end{align}

  To find the particular solution, we assume the particular solution is of the
  form $u_p(x) = \kappa(x) e^{\omega x}$ for some unknown function $\kappa(x)$.
  Thus,
  \[
    u_p''(x) = \kappa''(x) e^{\omega x} + 2 \omega \kappa'(x) e^{\omega x} + \omega^2 \kappa(x) e^{\omega x},
  \]
  and substituting the above into the original differential equation $Lu = f$
  with $u_p(x) = \kappa(x) e^{\omega x}$ we have
  \begin{align}\label{particular_step_one}
    \kappa''(x) + 2\omega\kappa'(x) = -f(x)e^{-\omega x}.
  \end{align}
  Making the substitution $\lambda(x) = \kappa'(x)$ into \eqref{particular_step_one}
  we can reduce the above second order linear differential equation into the
  first order linear differential equation
  \begin{align}\label{particular_step_two}
    \lambda'(x) + 2\omega\lambda(x) = -f(x)e^{-\omega x}.
  \end{align}
  The homogeneous solution to this first order differential equation is given by
  $\lambda_h(x) = c_3 e^{-2\omega x}$ suggesting the particular solution to the
  first order differential equation is of the form $\lambda_p(x) = \mu(x) e^{-2\omega x}$.

  Repeating the same process as above, we see that
  \[
    \lambda_p'(x) = \mu'(x) e^{-2 \omega x} - 2 \omega\mu(x) e^{-2 \omega x}
  \]
  and substituting into \eqref{particular_step_two} with $\lambda_p(x) = \mu(x) e^{-2\omega x}$
  we find that the first order linear differential equation becomes the separable first order differential
  equation
  \[
    \mu'(x) = -f(x)e^{\omega x}.
  \]
  We readily see the solution to the above differential equation is given by
  \[
    \mu(x) = - \int_{0}^x f(r) e^{\omega r} dr.
  \]
  As $\kappa'(x) = \lambda_p(x) = \mu(x)e^{-2\omega x}$, we deduce that
  \begin{align*}
    \kappa(x) = - \int_{0}^{x} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds
  \end{align*}
  and
  \begin{align}\label{particular_solution}
    u_p(x) = \kappa(x)e^{\omega x} = -e^{\omega x} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds.
  \end{align}
  Combining the homogeneous solution \eqref{homogeneous_solution} and the particular
  solution \eqref{particular_solution} we have that the general solution to
  $Lu = f$ is given by
  \begin{align}\label{general_analytical_solution}
    u(x) &= u_h(x) + u_p(x) \nonumber \\
    &= c_1 e^{\omega x} + c_2 e^{-\omega x} - e^{\omega x} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds.
  \end{align}
  Using the boundary values provided in $Lu=f$, the general solution is specified
  by the system of linear equations
  \begin{align*}
    u(0) &= c_1 + c_2 = \epsilon \\
    u(1) &= c_1 e^{\omega} + c_2 e^{-\omega} - e^{\omega} \int_{0}^{1} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds = \delta .
  \end{align*}
  The solution to this system in terms of the unknowns $c_1$ and $c_2$ is given
  by
  \begin{align*}
    c_1 = \frac{\epsilon e^{-\omega} - \delta - e^{\omega} \int_{0}^{1} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds}{e^{-\omega} - e^{\omega}}\\
    c_2 = \frac{-\epsilon e^{-\omega} + \delta + e^{\omega} \int_{0}^{1} e^{-2 \omega s} \left[ \int_{0}^s f(r) e^{\omega r} dr \right] ds}{e^{-\omega} - e^{\omega}}.
  \end{align*}

  Using these constants in \eqref{general_analytical_solution} gives us the
  unique analytical solution to the family of differential equation $Lu = f$.
  Furthermore, we deduce that the problem is in fact well-posed.

  From this solution, we must make the following additional assumption on this
  problem:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $f(x)$ must be integrable on the interval $[0, 1]$.
  \end{itemize}
  As the analytical solution depends on the symbolic integration of $f(x)$, we
  will be unable to use this solution for functions $f(x)$ in which the
  closed-form of the integral is not known.
