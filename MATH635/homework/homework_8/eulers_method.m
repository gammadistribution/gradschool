function [t, u] = eulers_method(func, interval, eta, n, epsilon)
% Computes the approximate solution to the first order cauchy problem 
% over the passed interval where func(t, y) is the first order derivative 
% of y. Note that eta is the initial condition of the problem, n is the
% number of partitions of the interval to compute the solution, and epsilon
% is the error in the value of the initial condition. 
% 
% Returns the points within the interval used to compute the solution, t, 
% and the values of the first derivative at those points.
