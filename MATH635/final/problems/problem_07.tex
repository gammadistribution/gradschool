\begin{problem}
  Finish the Laplace equation
  \begin{align}\label{laplace}
    -\triangle u &= f(x) \quad \text{on $\Omega$} \notag \\
    u &= 0 \quad \text{on $d\Omega$}
  \end{align}
  solution by finite element
  space using the seven hat functions on hexagons as a basis where $f(x) = -x + 1$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  We wish to find an approximation to the exact solution $u(x, y)$ in the form
  \[
    u_7(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^6 a_i \phi_i(x, y)
  \]
  where $\phi_j(x, y)$ are the hat functions with support on the hexagon of definition, i.e.
  we define $\phi_j(x)$ to be 1 on the center nodes of the hexagon and 0 on the boundary.
  Refer to Figure \ref{mesh} for the location of the nodes of these basis functions.
  Note that for the triangles in the mesh the basis functions form a plane whose equation we must define.

  \end{figure}

  As discussed in class, the weak formulation of the differential equation
  \label{laplace} is as follows
  \[
    \int_\Omega \triangledown u(x, y) \cdot \triangledown\phi_i(x, y) d\Omega = \int_\Omega f(x)\phi_i(x, y)d\Omega \quad \text{for $i=0,\dots,6$}.
  \]
  Discretizing the solution $u(x, y)$ with the approximation $u_7(x, y)$, we
  then require our approximation to satisfy the following system
  \begin{align}\label{laplace_system}
    \sum_{j=0}^6 a_j \int_\Omega \triangledown \phi_j(x, y) \cdot \triangledown \phi_i(x, y) d\Omega = \int_\Omega f(x)\phi_i(x, y)d\Omega \quad \text{for $i=0,\dots,6$}.
  \end{align}
  This system is then given by $Ax = b$ where $A = [a_{ij}]$ is the stiffness matrix
  of the differential equation with $a_{ij} = \int_\Omega \triangledown \phi_j(x, y) \cdot \triangledown \phi_i(x, y) d\Omega$
  and $b = [b_i]$ with $b_i = \int_\Omega f(x)\phi_i(x, y)d\Omega$ for $i=0,\dots,6$. The vector $x$ is the solution vector of the system
  and defines the coefficients in our approximation.

\end{proof}
