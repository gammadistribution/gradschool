With the advent of social media, the way in which society communicates has evolved. Popular
social media networks document these new forms of communications and as a result a rich
set of data surrounding these interactions emerges. In particular, Twitter
remains one of the most popular social media platforms
to date. Twitter was first launched in July 2006 as a social networking service
designed to allow its users to communicate via short 140-character messages
called ``tweets''. These tweets are sometimes affixed by the sender with a meta-label
called a ``hashtag'', denoted by a string leading with the \# symbol, that is
meant to categorize the information contained in the
message. Twitter currently has an active user base of 302 million users sending
these categorized messages every second.

In this report, we will analyze data pertaining to a popular television show
collected from Twitter's streaming API over the course of three weeks. This
analysis will consist of measuring the number of tweets containing a certain
hashtag occuring in a given hour during this timeframe. We will then fit a time
series model to these measurements and provide a forecasting model of the next
week's projected data.
