\begin{problem}{4.29}
  An organization has $N$ employees where $N$ is a large number. Each employee
  has one of three possible job classifications and changes classifications (independently)
  according to a Markov chain with transition probabilities
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\
      0.2 & 0.6 & 0.2 \\
      0.1 & 0.4 & 0.5
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align*}
  What percentage of employees are in each classification?
\end{problem}
