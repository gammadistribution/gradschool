\begin{problem}{4.33}
  A professor continually gives exams to her students. She can give three possible types
  of exams, and her class is graded as either having done well or badly. Let $p_i$
  denote the probability that the class does well on a type $i$ exam, and suppose that
  $p_1 = 0.3$, $p_2 = 0.6$, and $p_3 = 0.9$. If the class does well on an exam,
  then the next exam is equally likely to be any of the three types. If the class
  does badly, then the next exam is always type 1. What proportion of exams
  are type $i$?
