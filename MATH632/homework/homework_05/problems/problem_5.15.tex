\begin{problem}{5.15}
  One hundred items are simultaneously put on a life test. Suppose the lifetimes of the
  individual items are independent exponential random variables with mean 200 hours.
  The test will end when there have been a total of 5 failures. If $T$ is the time at which the test
  ends, find $E[T]$ and $\text{Var}[T]$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $T_i$ be the time between the $(i-1)$-th and the $i$-th failure.
  Note that from a previous proposition, we have that if $X_1, \dots, X_n$
  are independent exponential random variables all with rate $\lambda = 1/200$,
  then $\min_i X_i$ is exponential with rate $n \lambda$. Thus, the shortest lifetime
  among the $100$ initial items is exponential with rate $100 \lambda$, i.e. the time that
  it takes for the first failure to occur, $T_1$, is exponential with rate $100\lambda$.

  In general, after the $(i-1)$-th failure, there will be $101 - i$ items left to test. Thus,
  the shortest lifetime among the $101 - i$ items is exponential with rate $(101 - i) \lambda$, i.e. the time that
  it takes for the $i$-t failure to occur, $T_i$, is exponential with rate $(101-i)\lambda$.

  Since each $T_i$ is exponential with rate $(101-i)\lambda$, we have that
  \begin{align*}
    E[T_i] = \frac{1}{(101-i)\lambda} = \frac{200}{(101-i)}, \quad \text{Var}[T_i] = \frac{1}{(101-i)^2\lambda^2} = \frac{200^2}{(101-i)^2}.
  \end{align*}

  If the test ends after 5 failures and if $T$ is the total time that the test takes,
  then $T = T_1 +\dots + T_5$ and
  \begin{align*}
    E[T] = \sum_{i=1}^5 E[T_i] = \sum_{i=1}^5 \frac{200}{(101-i)} = 10.2062.
  \end{align*}

  Since each $T_i$ is independent, we have that
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Var}[T] = \sum_{i=1}^5  \text{Var}[T_i] = \sum_{i=1}^5 \frac{200^2}{(101-i)^2} = 20.8377.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
