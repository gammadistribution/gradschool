\begin{problem}{5.43}
  Customers arrive at a two-server service station according to a Poisson process
  with rate $\lambda$. Whenever a new customer arrives, any customer that is in
  the system immediately departs. A new arrival enters first with server 1
  and then with server 2. If the service times are independent exponentials
  with respective rates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, what proportion of entering
  customers complete their service with server 2?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $T_1$ denote the amount of time spent with server 1 and $T_2$ denote
  the amount of time spent with server 2. Note that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are
  independent and exponentially distributed with rates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, respectively.

  Let $T$ be the amount of time before the next customer arrives. Since $T$ is
  the arrival time of some event of a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$,
  we have that $T$ is exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda$.

  Let $p$ be the proportion of customers that complete their service with server 2.
  Note that $p$ will be the proportion of time between inter-arrivals that is greater than $T_1 + T_2$.
  This will be the probability that $T > T_1 + T_2$, i.e.\
  \begin{align*}
    p = P(T > T_1 + T_2)
  \end{align*}

  Since $T$ is exponentially distributed and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are independent, we have that
  \begin{align}\label{form}
    p &= P(T > T_1 + T_2) \notag \\
    &= P(T > T_1)P(T > T_2) \notag \\
    &= \int_0^\infty P(T > T_1 \mid T = t) f_{T}(t) dt \int_0^\infty P(T > T_2 \mid T = t) f_{T}(t) dt \notag \\
    &= \int_0^\infty \lambda(1-e^{-\mu_1 t})e^{-\lambda t} dt \int_0^\infty \lambda(1-e^{-\mu_2 t})e^{-\lambda t} dt \notag \\
    &= \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_1 + \lambda} \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_2 + \lambda}.
  \end{align}

  Therefore, \eqref{form} is the proportion of customers that complete their services with server 2.
\end{proof}
