\begin{problem}{3.8}
  An unbiased die is successively rolled. Let $X$ and $Y$ denote, respectively, the number
  of rolls necessary to obtain a six and a five. Find:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $E[X]$,
    \item $E[X|Y=1]$,
    \item $E[X|Y=5]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The experiment of rolling a die, assuming the die is six-sided, has
  six possible outcomes: the die lands oriented such that the side with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
  pips is face-up. Assuming the die is unbiased, each outcome occurs with probability
  $p=1/6$ and each trial of rolling the die is independent of any other trial.
  If $X$ and $Y$ denote, respectively, the number
  of rolls necessary to obtain a six and a five, then under the given assumptions,
  $X$ and $Y$ are both geometric random variables with parameter $p=1/6$.
  The probability mass function for these random variables is given by $p(n) = (1-p)^{n-1}p = (5/6)^{n-1}(1/6)$.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item By definition, we have that the expectation of $X$ is given by
      \begin{align*}
        E[X] = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n p(n) = 1/6\sum_{n=1}^\infty n(5/6)^{n-1}.
      \end{align*}
      We know that the power series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (5/6)^{n}$ converges uniformly
    \item
    \item
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
