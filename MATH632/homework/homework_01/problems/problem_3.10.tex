\begin{problem}{3.10}
  Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are independent continuous random variables. Show that
  \begin{align*}
    E[X|Y=y] = E[X] \text{ for all y.}
  \end{align*}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are continuous, independent random variables with probability
  density functions $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, respectively. The conditional probability density
  function of $X$ given that $Y=y$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
    f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}
  \end{align*}
  where $f(x, y)$ is the joint probability density function of $X$ and $Y$. Due to the independence
  of the random variables $X$ and $Y$, we have that $f(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$. Thus, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then
  the conditional probability density function of $X$ given that $Y=y$ is
  \begin{align}\label{ind_con}
    f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)} = \frac{f_X(x)f_Y(y)}{f_Y(y)} = f_X(x).
  \end{align}
  Therefore, combining the definition of conditional expectation for continuous random variables
  and result \eqref{ind_con}, we have that for any $y$,
  \begin{align*}
    E[X|Y=y] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_{X|Y}(x|y) dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x) dx = E[X]
  \end{align*}
  and we are done.\end{proof}
