\begin{problem}{3.9}
  Show in the discrete case that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then
  \begin{align*}
    E[X|Y=y] = E[X] \text{ for all y.}
  \end{align*}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are discrete, independent random variables. Then, due to
  the independence of the random variables, we know that
  \begin{align}\label{ind}
    P\{X=x|Y=y\} &= \frac{P\{X=x, Y=y\}}{P\{Y=y\}} \notag\\
    &= \frac{P\{X=x\}P\{Y=y\}}{P(Y=y)} \notag\\
    &= P\{X=x\}.
  \end{align}
  Therefore, combining the definition of conditional expectation for discrete random variables
  and result \eqref{ind}, we have that for any $y$,
  \begin{align*}
    E[X|Y=y] &= \sum_x x P\{X=x | Y=y\} = \sum_x x P\{X=x\} = E[X]
  \end{align*}
  and we are done.
\end{proof}
