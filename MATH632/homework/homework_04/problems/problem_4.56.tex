\begin{problem}{4.56}
  Suppose that on each play of the game a gambler either wins 1 with probability $p$
  or loses 1 with probability $1 - p$. The gambler continues betting until she or
  he is either up $n$ or down $m$. What is the probability that the gambler quits a winner?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Note that the described scenario is a modified gambler's ruin problem where the game
  ends if the fortune of the player is either $N = n + m$ or $0$ and the starting fortune
  of the gambler is given by $m$. We know that the probability
  that the gambler will quit a winner given that the initial fortune of the gambler is $i$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
    P_i =
    \begin{cases}
      \displaystyle
      \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^i}{1 - \left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^{m+n}} & \text{if $p = 1 - p$} \\
      \frac{1}{m+n} & \text{if $p \neq 1- p$}
    \end{cases}.
  \end{align*}

  Therefore, the probability that the gambler will quit a winner is given by
  \begin{align*}
    P_m =
    \begin{cases}
      \displaystyle
      \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^m}{1 - \left(\frac{1-p}{p}\right)^{m+n}} & \text{if $p = 1 - p$} \\
      \frac{m}{m+n} & \text{if $p \neq 1- p$}
    \end{cases}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
