\begin{problem}{4.16}
  Show that if state $i$ is recurrent and state $i$ does not communicate with state
  $j$, then $P_{ij} = 0$. This implies that once a process enters a recurrent class
  of states it can never leave that class. For this reason, a recurrent class
  is often referred to as a \emph{closed} class.
