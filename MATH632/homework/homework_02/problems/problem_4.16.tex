\begin{problem}{4.16}
  Show that if state $i$ is recurrent and state $i$ does not communicate with state
  $j$, then $P_{ij} = 0$. This implies that once a process enters a recurrent class
  of states it can never leave that class. For this reason, a recurrent class
  is often referred to as a \emph{closed} class.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that state $i$ is recurrent and that state $i$ does not communicate with state $j$.
  If state $i$ does not communicate with state $j$, then either state $j$ is not accessible
  from state $i$ or state $i$ is not accessible from state $j$, i.e.\ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$,
  either $P_{ij}^m = 0$ or $P_{ji}^m = 0$.

  If $P_{ij}^m = 0$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$, then it is true in particular for $m=1$ so
  that $P_{ij} = 0$ and we are done.

  Now, suppose to the contrary that state $i$ is not accessible from state $j$, i.e.\
  $P_{ji}^m = 0$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$, but $P_{ij} > 0$  with state $i$ a recurrent state.
  If $P_{ij} > 0$, then there is a non-zero probability of entering state $j$ from state $i$. However,
  if $P_{ji}^m = 0$ for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$, then once entering state $j$ from state $i$
  we will never re-enter state $i$. However, this contradicts the assumption that
  state $i$ is recurrent, i.e.\ that it occurs with probability 1 that starting from state $i$ we
  will eventually transition to state $i$. Therefore, in either case, if state $i$ is
  recurrent and state $i$ does not communicate with state $j$, then $P_{ij} = 0$.
