\begin{problem}{4.8}
  Suppose that coin 1 has probability 0.7 of coming up heads and coin 2 has probability
  0.6 of coming up heads. If the coin flipped today comes up heads, then we select
  coin 1 to flip tomorrow and if it comes up tails then we select coin 2 to flip tomorrow.
  If the coin initially flipped is equally likely to be coin 1 or coin 2, then
  what is the probability that the coin flipped on the third day after the initial
  flip is coin 1? Suppose that the coin flipped on Monday comes up heads. What is the probability
  that the coin flipped on Friday of the same week also comes up heads?
