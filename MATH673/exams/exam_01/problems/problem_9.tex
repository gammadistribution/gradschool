\begin{problem}{9}
  Show that if $E$ is a solution of an $m$-th order partial differential equation
  \begin{align*}
    P(\partial)u = \sum_{k=0}^m a_k \partial^k u = \delta,
  \end{align*}
  where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function, then $E \ast f$ is the solution of
  the partial differential equation $P(\partial)u = f$, where $\ast$ is the convolution.
