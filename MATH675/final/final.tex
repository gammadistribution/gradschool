% Problem 1
\begin{problem}
  Approximate the roots of $\varepsilon x^3 + x^2 +x - 2 = 0$, $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, with
  precision $O(\varepsilon^2)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  When $\varepsilon = 0$, the unperturbed equation only has two roots while the original equation
  has three roots implying that this is a singular perturbation problem.

  To find the other root of this equation we must employ the method of dominant balance on the
  original equation. There are six possible two-term balances to consider as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose that $\varepsilon x^3 \sim x^2$ is the dominant balance and that $x \ll x^2$, $1 \ll x^2$.
      If $\varepsilon x^3 \sim x^2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x = O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, which is consistent
      with the assumptions that $x \ll x^2$ and $1 \ll x^2$ and the balance itself is consistent.

    \item Suppose that $\varepsilon x^3 \sim x$ is the dominant balance and that $x^2 \ll x$, $1 \ll x$.
      If $\varepsilon x^3 \sim x$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x = O(\varepsilon^{-1/2})$.
      However, if $x = O(\varepsilon^{-1/2})$, then
      \begin{align*}
        \frac{x^2}{x} = \frac{\left(\varepsilon^{-1/2}\right)^2}{\varepsilon^{-1/2}} = \varepsilon^{-1/2}
      \end{align*}
      which implies that as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$ the assumption that $x^2 \ll x$ is false and that this balance is inconsistent.

    \item Suppose that $\varepsilon x^3 \sim 2$ is the dominant balance and that $x^2 \ll 1$, $x \ll 1$.
      If $\varepsilon x^3 \sim 2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x = O(\varepsilon^{-1/3})$, which
      implies that as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$ the assumption that $x \ll 1$ is false and that this balance is inconsistent.

    \item Suppose that $x^2 \sim x$ is the dominant balance and that $\varepsilon x^3 \ll x$, $1 \ll x$.
      If $x^2 \sim x$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x \sim 1$ and $x = O(1)$, which is consistent with the assumptions
      that $\varepsilon x^3 \ll 1$ and $x^2 \ll 1$ and the balance is consistent. Using this balance
      will recover the root $x=1$ from the unperturbed equation and the root can be expanded with a perturbation series in $\varepsilon$ in the normal way.

    \item Suppose that $x^2 \sim 2$ is the dominant balance and that $\varepsilon x^3 \ll 1$, $x \ll 1$.
      If $ x^2 \sim 2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x = O(1)$, which
      implies that as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$ the assumption that $x \ll 1$ is false and that this balance is inconsistent.

    \item Suppose that $x \sim -2$ is the dominant balance and that $\varepsilon x^3 \ll 1$, $x^2 \ll 1$.
      If $x \sim -2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, then $x = O(1)$, which is consistent with the assumptions
      that $\varepsilon x^3 \ll 1$ and $x^2 \ll 1$ and the balance is consistent. Using this balance
      will recover the root $x=-2$ from the unperturbed equation and the root can be expanded with a perturbation series in $\varepsilon$ in the normal way.
  \end{enumerate}
  Assuming the balance in case a., we see that the roots of the equation are of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$.
  Making the transformation $x = \varepsilon^{-1}y$ we see that the original equation becomes
  \begin{align}\label{new_pert}
    y^3 + y^2 + \varepsilon y -2 \varepsilon^2 = 0.
  \end{align}
  Suppose that the roots of the equation \eqref{new_pert} can be expressed in terms of $\varepsilon$, i.e.\
  \begin{align*}
    y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \varepsilon^n.
  \end{align*}
  Suppose $y = a_0 + a_1 \varepsilon + a_2 \varepsilon^2 + a_3 \varepsilon^3 + O(\varepsilon^4)$. Substituting $y$ into \eqref{new_pert} and equating coefficients of $\varepsilon$,
  we see that the following equations must be satisfied:
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{ll}
      a_0^2 + a_0^3 &= 0 \\
      a_0 + 2 a_0 a_1 + 3 a_0^2 a_1 &= 0\\
      -2 + a_1 + a_1^2 + 3 a_0 a_1^2 + 2 a_0 a_2 + 3 a_0^2 a_2&= 0 \\
      a_1^3 + a_2 + 2 a_1 a_2 + 6 a_0 a_1 a_2 + 2 a_0 a_3 + 3 a_0^2 a_3 &= 0
    \end{array}
  \end{align*}

  When $a_0 = -1$, we see from the second equation that $a_1 = 1$, from the third equation that
  $a_2 = 3$, and from the fourth equation that $a_3 = 8$. Thus, the root $x_1$ to the original equation is given by
  \begin{align*}
    x_1 = \varepsilon^{-1}y = \varepsilon^{-1}\left(-1 + \varepsilon + 3 \varepsilon^2 + 8 \varepsilon^3 + O(\varepsilon^4)\right) = -\varepsilon^{-1} + 1 + 3 \varepsilon + 8 \varepsilon^2 + O(\varepsilon^3).
  \end{align*}
  accurate to precision $O(\varepsilon^2)$.

  When $a_0 = 0$, we have two possibilities from the above system of non-linear equations, either
  $a_1 = -2$, $a_2 = -8/3$, $a_3 = 0$ or $a_1=1$, $a_2 = -1/3$, $a_3 = 0$.
  Thus, the second and third roots $x_2, x_3$ to the original equation are given by
  \begin{align*}
    x_2 = \varepsilon^{-1}y = \varepsilon^{-1}\left(-2\varepsilon -\frac{8}{3} \varepsilon^2  + O(\varepsilon^4)\right) = -2 -\frac{8}{3} \varepsilon  + O(\varepsilon^3).
  \end{align*}
  and
  \begin{align*}
    x_3 = \varepsilon^{-1}y = \varepsilon^{-1}\left(\varepsilon -\frac{1}{3} \varepsilon^2  + O(\varepsilon^4)\right) = 1 -\frac{1}{3} \varepsilon  + O(\varepsilon^3).
  \end{align*}
  both accurate to precision $O(\varepsilon^2)$. Note that when $a_0 =0$ we have recovered the roots to the unperturbed equation and their actual order is $\varepsilon$.

  Therefore, the three roots to the equation $\varepsilon x^3 + x^2 +x - 2 = 0$, $\varepsilon \to 0^+$ are given by
  \begin{align*}
    x_1 &= -\varepsilon^{-1} + 1 + 3 \varepsilon + 8 \varepsilon^2 + O(\varepsilon^3) \\
    x_2 &= -2 -\frac{8}{3} \varepsilon  + O(\varepsilon^3) \\
    x_3 &= 1 -\frac{1}{3} \varepsilon  + O(\varepsilon^3)
  \end{align*}
  all accurate to precision $O(\varepsilon^2)$.
\end{proof}
